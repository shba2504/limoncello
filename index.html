          <img src="./images/chefs-jason-jarrach.jpg" />
          <p>
            Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is owned by two Italian
            brothers, Mario and Adrian. To craft the menu, Mario relies on
            family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does
            all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand
            the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines
            from the Mediterranean region.
