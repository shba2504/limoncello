            Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is owned by two Italian
            brothers, Mario and Adrian. They moved to the United States to
            pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu,
            Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in
            Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the
            effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate
            additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
